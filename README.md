# AdvGAN vs face recognition
Applying AdvGAN for attacking face-recognition model & exploring advantages of WGAN objective.

- ./GAN -- basic GAN architeture
- ./Baseline -- AdvGan implementation and experiments. The model is applied against a simple CNN trained on MNIST dataset and Inception ResNet V1 trained on CASIA-WebFace. Notebooks contain the training process, plots and results for WGAN objective.
